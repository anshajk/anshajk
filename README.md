### Hi there 👋
This is the place where I git gud (pun intended) 👨🏻‍💻

- 🔭 I’m currently in a planning phase, where I'm conceptualising some of the things I want to implement
- 🌱 I’m currently learning devops
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to software, ML or astronomy

You can connect with me here - https://topmate.io/anshaj

Someone is trying to impersonate me at X at @khare_anshaj. Please report and don't fall for the BS they're selling
  
I currently write at https://compute.anshaj.dev
